# PyTerminal
A QT-based terminal emulator written in Python.

**NOTE:** This is very much so a "work-in-progress" program! Not all features work yet. Particularly there are some bugs with other shells (ie. running `python` or `node`) that don't work at the moment. I hope to address these in the future.

## How to Run
1. Set up a virtual environment with Python, version 3.9 or newer.
2. Enter the virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main application with `python main.py`.
